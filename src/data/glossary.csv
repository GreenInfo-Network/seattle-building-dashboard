4,Property Name,Name of property as reported by owner or owner’s agent in Portfolio Manager,
5,Council District,"The City of Seattle is divided into 7 Council Districts, with a Councilmember representing each district. There are also 2 citywide Councilmembers representing the entire city. For more information visit: www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhoods-and-districts",
6,Neighborhoods,Seattle communities classified into the neighborhoods used by the Department of Neighborhoods for planning and outreach purposes.,
7,Address,Address as reported by owner,
8,Year Built,"The year property was constructed, as reported by owner",
9,Primary Property Type - Calculated,"The Primary Use of the Property, as calculated by Portfolio Manager based on the owner's selections. For use types that do not receive an ENERGY STAR® Score, OSE has simplified these types into broader categories for analysis. ",https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/tools/Property%20Use%20Details%20and%20Definition%20updated%204-21-17.pdf
10,Gross Floor Area,The Gross Floor Area as recorded by the King County Assessor’s Office in square feet,
11,ENERGY STAR Score,"The 1-100 score calculated by ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® that measures how well the property is performing relative to similar properties, when normalized for climate and operational characteristics. The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that at a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR Certification.

14,Source EUI (kBtu/ft²),"Source Energy Use divided by property square footage, normalized for weather. Weather-normalization is based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather data for the zip code. Source Energy Use is the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the property. In addition to what the property consumes on-site, source energy includes losses that take place during generation, transmission, and distribution of the energy, thereby enabling a complete assessment of energy consumption resulting from building operations. For this reason, Source EUI is the best way to quantify the energy performance of commercial buildings. More:Reference Link",
17,Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft²),"The total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, divided by the floor area of the building, in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per square foot. ",
18,Electricity Use (kWh),"The total annual electricity consumed by the property, both sourced from the electrical grid and generated from any onsite renewable energy generation systems (if applicable), in kilowatt-hours (kWh).",
19,Natural Gas Use (therms),"The total annual natural gas consumed by the property, in therms (1 therm equals 100,000 British Thermal Units (Btus), and is approximately equal to the energy content of 100 cubic feet (CCF) of natural gas.",
20,Latitude,Geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface,
12,Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI), as calculated by Portfolio Manager, at the property site. This equals the amount of energy consumed at the site in thousand British thermal units (kBtus) per gross square foot (kBtu/ft2) of the property. Site EUI values are the result of self-reported entries.",https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/what-energy
13,Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),"Weather normalized Site Energy Use Intensity is the Site EUI in kBtu/ft2 of the property, normalized for weather. Weather normalization facilitates the comparison between different parts of the country and corrects for year-to-year differences in weather. Weather normalized energy is the energy your building would have used under 30-year average conditions (also referred to as climate normals). The weather in a given year may be much hotter or colder than the normal climate; weather normalized energy accounts for this difference. Note that the adjustment is for weather only, but not climate. That is, the metric evaluates your building over time, but does not account for differences between your building and other locations that have different average (normal) climates. Weather Normalized Source EUI values are the result of self-reported entries.",https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/portfolio-manager-technical-reference-climate-and-weather
21,Longitude,Geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface,
16,Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e),"The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This calculation uses a GHG emissions factor from Seattle CIty Lights portfolio of generating resources, a reported emissions factor from CenTrio for steam, and an EPA estimated factor for fossil gas.",
15,Weather Normalized Source EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The Weather Normalized Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is the source EUI (kBtu/ft2) of the property, normalized for weather. Weather normalization facilitates comparison between different parts of the country and corrects for year-to-year differences in weather. Weather normalized energy is the energy your building would have used under 30-year average conditions (also referred to as climate normals). The weather in a given year may be much hotter or colder than the normal climate; weather normalized energy accounts for this difference. Weather Normalized Source EUI values are the result of self-reported entries.",https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/benchmark/understand_metrics/source_site_difference
