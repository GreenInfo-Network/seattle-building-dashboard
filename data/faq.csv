4,Where can I find more information about the data fields and metrics?,"For the metrics located in the panel on the left-hand side of the screen, you can click on “More Info” to read more details on how that metric is defined and the source of the data/how it is reported to the City of Seattle. Additionally, there is a glossary of terms for this website, which can be accessed by clicking ""Glossary"" at the bottom of the screen."
5,Why do some of the dots or shapes appear gray?,"All of the dots or shapes will display the color of the relative color range scale found within the metric you have selected. However, if a specific property does not contain data for the metric you have selected, the dot or shape associated with that property will appear grayed out. For example, if you have selected ENERGY STAR score as the current display metric, any properties that do not have an ENERGY STAR score will appear as a gray dot on the map. Not all types of properties are eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score."
6,What are the benefits of benchmarking?,"Annual energy benchmarking shows property owners and managers how their buildings are using - and wasting - energy. Benchmarking is a first step towards lowering energy costs and staying competitive.
Energy benchmarking helps businesses and consumers make more informed decisions that take actual energy costs into account when buying or renting property.
Benchmarking and managing your building’s energy use can lower energy costs to owners and tenants, reduce greenhouse gas impacts, and create jobs in the energy services and construction trades.
The collection of benchmarking data establishes energy performance ranges for Seattle building types based on their reported energy use to help owners see how their building's energy use stacks up to their peers.
Reported local building performance data allows the City to track its energy reduction goals and target incentive dollars by market sector.

8,Does this map show the energy usage for all of Seattle’s buildings?,"The City of Seattle’s benchmarking law (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 22.920) applies to privately-owned commercial and multifamily properties over 20,000 square feet and City of Seattle owned properties over 5,000 square feet. Owners of buildings under these thresholds can voluntarily report their energy usage to the City of Seattle, but the map will only display the information for the City’s largest commercial and multifamily properties. Buildings owned by the Federal government and buildings used primarily for industrial/manufacturing entities are exempt from the benchmarking law and thus their information is not included in this public disclosure. Additionally, single-family residential buildings are also not included in this dataset."
11,Why are the building shapes on the map in different colors?,"The colors of the dots represent the relative scale for the selected metric that you are currently viewing on the map. The metrics are listed on the left-hand side of the screen within the categories of Property Information, Energy Performance Metrics, and Greenhouse (GHG) Emissions. For example, the map is colored by the ENERGY STAR score metric by default, and each dot is colored based on where that building’s ENERGY STAR score falls on the color scale for ENERGY STAR score (1-100). The buildings with lower ENERGY STAR scores are represented as a red dot, whereas the buildings with higher ENERGY STAR scores are blue. To refine the metric filters, users can select a specific building type to focus on. The default is Show All Buildings."
7,What is the purpose of the Energy Benchmarking visualization site?,"Each year, the Seattle Office of Sustainability and Environment publishes energy performance benchmarking data from the largest commercial and multifamily buildings in the city. Data is disclosed annually at seattle.data.gov, the city’s open data platform as well as this interactive map. In response to changes in Seattle’s transparency guidelines, Seattle building owners and stakeholders requested the data be shared in an easy to use format in addition to the disclosure of this information in raw data spreadsheets. Visualization of benchmarking data helps building owners, managers and tenants understand what energy usage in Seattle’s buildings looks like. "
10,What is the building report?,"Beginning with 2015 benchmarking data, building reports will be available online for all reporting building types. In prior years, building owners and managers of five building types were sent building performance profiles highlighting their building’s performance compared to other buildings in Seattle of the same type. Seattle is now annually displaying building performance metrics such as the December ending EUI and ENERGY STAR score compared to similar building types in Seattle. This peer comparison highlights if the building is higher or lower than the average performing building of that type in Seattle. Additionally, a toggle view allows users to see where the building’s Energy Use Intensity (EUI) or ENERGY STAR Score falls in comparison to others of the same type. The site defaults to Site EUI, showing the annual Dec. ending EUI as either lowest (blue), medium low (green), medium high (yellow) or highest (red) energy use"
12,The map defaults to ENERGY STAR score as the selected metric. How do I change this?,"You can change the metric associated with the color of the dots by selecting a new metric category on the left-hand side of the screen and then selecting the specific metric you would like to view. The categories include: Property Information, Energy Performance Metrics, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. The actual metrics available for selection include: Property Size, Year Built, ENERGY STAR score, Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) , Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI), Site Total Energy Use, Total GHG Emissions, and GHG Intensity.

After selecting a specific metric, the color of the dots or shapes on the map will re-configure to represent the relative color scale associated with that metric. The color scale is ordered based on the energy performance of the building, with the blue color representing a lower energy use building, and red representing a higher energy use building. Within these metric selections, you also have the ability to filter the information to see what range of data you wish to view for that specific metric by sliding the scale buttons up or down. For example, if you only wish to see the buildings with ENERGY STAR scores of 25-50 represented on the map, you would select the ENERGY STAR score metric on the left-hand side. You would then move the lower-range slider to 25 and the higher-range slider to 75. The map will adjust accordingly.

Note that you can set more than one metric filter at a time. For example, you could take a look at all of the buildings between 20,000 and 30,000 gross square feet that have an ENERGY STAR score between 25-50 by sliding the scales for these metrics in the appropriate place. While multiple filters can be applied at the same time, the color of the dots will reflect the most recent metric you have selected.
"
13,What do the data fields at the top of the map represent?,"There are three fields that appear at the top of the map: Building address, Neighborhood, and Council District. The Building Address field is a search box where you can search for a specific building address within the benchmarking map. This field will automatically show buildings by name in addition to building address to help you find the facility you are searching for. 

The other two fields for Neighborhood or Council District allow you to further filter the information that is displayed on the map. You can select each metric by simply clicking on the blue button for that field and then choosing the filters you wish to remove from the dropdown list that appears. The default is set to display all. After making your selection in the filter, you can remove the dropdown by clicking on the field name again.

For example, if you only want to view the properties that are located in Council District 1, then you would select the data field Council District at the top of the screen, uncheck all of the Districts except for 1 in the dropdown, and then click the Council District filter name again to make the dropdown disappear. Note that these filters work in conjunction with any filters you have applied within the metrics on the left-hand side of the screen. So, if you have the scale for ENERGY STAR score set at 25-50 and then select only Council District 1 from the dropdown at the top of the screen, you will only see the properties that have an ENERGY STAR score of 25-50 located in Council District 1. You can easily unselect and re-select all filters in the data fields at the top by clicking ""Show All"" or ""Hide All"" from the dropdown. Additionally, you can reset all filters by clicking on ""Reset All"" near the Metric Filters heading on the left-hand side of the screen.

14,I thought the City of Seattle had collected several years of benchmarking data. What year(s) of data does the map display?,"Currently, the Seattle Energy Benchmarking map includes the 2015, and 2016 calendar years of benchmarking data, with the map display defaulting to the most recent set of data. You can switch between the calendar year data by moving the slider in the upper right-hand corner of the screen (located below the city skyline) to the year of data that you wish to view. The map will automatically adjust based on the data year you select."
15,Where can I access the raw data for this map?,"You can view and download the raw data for this map by clicking ""Download Data"" at the bottom of the screen. This will bring you to Seattle Open Data portal page, where you will be able to access the benchmarking data for all published calendar years in an Excel or CSV format."
16,"I own, live or work a building that I believe is over 20,000 square feet and it’s not showing on this map. Why is that?","There are several reasons that a building would not appear on the energy benchmarking map. The building may be exempt from reporting for that specific calendar year due to building use, site redevelopment or its date of occupancy. The Seattle Benchmarking program relies on square footage records published by King County Assessor’s Records. Some buildings may not have reported any information to the City of Seattle and thus do not show up on the map. In the Seattle.data.gov portal, the building may be listed as out of compliance. If you believe there is a building missing from the map, please contact us at energybenchmarking@seattle.gov or 206-727-8484 so that we can investigate."
17,"I’m a building owner, and the benchmarking data shows that my building uses a lot of energy or is low-performing. Where can I get help to make it more efficient?","We partner with Seattle City Light, Puget Sound Energy and EnWave to help connect you to incentive programs that can assist you in your efforts to make your building more efficient. Sends us a note at energybenchmarking@seattle.gov or 206-727-8484 so we can help you connect with an Energy Advisor. 
Is your building a non-residential building over 50,000 square feet? If so, your building will be required to complete a Building Tune-Up based on its size. Visit www.seattle.gov/buildingtuneups to learn more. Owners that conduct Building Tune-Ups can save 10-15% on energy use per PNNL’s Retuning Program research.

18,I have questions about this map or want to suggest improvements to this site. Where can I send my comments?,The Seattle Energy Benchmarking map is a new tool that we are continuing to improve. We welcome your feedback. You can submit your comments to the benchmarking program directly by emailing energybenchmarking@seattle.gov.
3,Why is energy benchmarking required in Seattle?,"Buildings account for approximately 33% of Seattle's core greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The benchmarking policy supports Seattle's goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings. In 2013, the City of Seattle adopted a Climate Action Plan to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency."
9,How do I find a specific building on the map?,"There are two ways to find a building on the Seattle Energy Benchmarking map interface. The first option is to search for a building address in the upper left-hand corner by typing the address in the ""Building Address"" field and hitting Enter on your computer keyboard or touchscreen keypad. The second way to find a building is by zooming in to the area of the city where the building is located, locating the cross street and/or building associated with the address, then clicking on the colored dot or footprint representing that facility and its associated benchmarking data. Note that some large campuses submit a single report for a group of their buildings; in those cases, the dot or outlined building for that campus may not cover all the buildings associated with that footprint. We are continuing to improve our visualization site so please let us know if you identify errors or corrections needed by emailing energybenchmarking@seattle.gov.

When you click on the colored footprint associated with a building, a pop-up box will appear with the Property Name, Address, Property Type, Property Size, OSE Building ID, Year Built, December ending EUI and ENERGY STAR Score. To see additional building performance data, click the VIEW BUILDING REPORT button."
